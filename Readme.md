# Guidelines


## Pseudo-code

How should your program work when you launch it? Write the pseudo code!

```ruby
# interface.rb

# Pseudo-code:
# 1. Print welcome and the horses names
# 2. Get user's bet
# 3. Run the race 🐴
# 4. Print results
```

Each step above is too general, so **try to build it out in a bit more detail**.

## Step 1 - Dumb horse race

Let's model a horse race. The user can bet on (choose) a horse, the horses run the race (the computer randomly selects a winner), and the winner is printed out in the terminal with a message telling the user if she/he won. Let's start with the pseudo code. How are we going to model the horses?

## Step 2 - Make it loop!

What about adding a balance to the game? Let's say you arrive to the horse race with 100€, win 50€ if you place a correct bet and lose 10€ if your horse does not win. What do you need to change to your horse race program? Let's make sure the user can't play if she/he does not have enough money.
